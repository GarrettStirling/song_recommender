## üéØ Primary Working Endpoint

**`/recommendations/search-based-discovery`** is the main working recommendation endpoint that:

- ‚úÖ Analyzes your top 100 tracks and genres
- ‚úÖ Uses search-based discovery to find new music
- ‚úÖ Excludes tracks you already have
- ‚úÖ Filters out artists you already know
- ‚úÖ Provides truly novel music recommendations
- ‚úÖ Works around Spotify API limitations

---

## üìù Notes

- The AI-powered endpoints (`default`, `custom`, `by-playlist`) may work if Spotify enables audio features access for your app
- The search-based discovery is the most reliable approach for novel music recommendations
- All authentication and data retrieval endpoints are working properly
